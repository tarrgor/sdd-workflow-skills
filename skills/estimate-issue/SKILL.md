description: This skill should be used to estimate a GitHub issue's implementation complexity and recommend the model to implement it with, before any code is written. Trigger phrases include "estimate issue #12", "how complex is this issue", "which model should implement this", "abschätzen", or whenever an issue's difficulty needs judging up front. Read-only — recommends, changes nothing. User-invoked: no other skill runs it.

# Estimate Issue

Judges one issue's implementation complexity and names the model to implement it with. Read-only: no file writes, no `gh` mutations, no branch or code changes.

The host's model names per tier are defined in `../_shared/runtime-adapters.md` (relative to this skill's directory); the Knowledge consultation discipline in `../_shared/conventions.md`.

## 1. Read the issue

- Identify the issue by number. If genuinely unclear, ask.
- `gh issue view <number> --comments` — title, body, labels, acceptance criteria, and the discussion.
- Skim the code the issue names or implies: the affected modules, their tests, and any obviously adjacent code. Skim only — this step must stay cheap relative to the implementation it precedes.
- Consult name-relevant `.project/Knowledge/` entries per the conventions discipline; a recorded gotcha in the affected area raises the estimate.

## 2. Score the complexity

Weigh these signals. Any single strong signal can carry the estimate — this is a judgement, not a points total.

- **Spread**: files and modules touched; one function, one module, or a cross-cutting change.
- **Design freedom**: an obvious local edit, or new abstractions, interfaces, or data structures that have to be invented.
- **Risk**: concurrency, persistence and migrations, auth and security, money, external APIs, protocol or format compatibility.
- **Reversibility**: a change that is cheap to correct later, or one that later work will build on.
- **Testability**: an existing test to extend, or a test harness that has to be built first.
- **Clarity**: acceptance criteria that decide every open question, or gaps the implementer has to fill.
- **Familiarity**: patterns already present in this codebase, or a library, protocol, or domain new to it.

Assign one tier:

| Tier | Looks like |
|---|---|
| **Low** | A local, well-specified change in a familiar pattern; an existing test extends to cover it. |
| **Medium** | Several files or a small new abstraction; some judgement calls, no serious risk. |
| **High** | Cross-cutting change, new design decisions, or a risk area (concurrency, migrations, security, external contracts). |
| **Exceptional** | Rare. Deep reasoning over an unfamiliar or intricate system, or a decision that later work is hard to unwind — an architecture rewrite, a hand-rolled algorithm or protocol, a subtle correctness proof. |

Estimate the *implementation*, not the wording of the issue: a one-line issue over an intricate subsystem is not a Low.

## 3. Report and hand over

Report in a few lines, no file written:

- the tier, and the two or three signals that decided it — name the actual files, risks, or gaps;
- the recommended model for this host, per `runtime-adapters.md`;
- anything the implementer should know up front: an ambiguity worth clarifying on the issue first, an open `Depends on #N` blocker, or a Knowledge entry that applies.

Recommend the model; never claim to have switched it. Switching the session model is the user's action.

End by naming the next step — set the model if it differs from the current one, then run `implement-issue <number>`.
