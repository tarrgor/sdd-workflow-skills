description: This skill should be used to drop a requirement, idea, or observation into the `.project/Inbox/` of another workflow project, from whatever directory the session runs in. Trigger phrases include "put this in the inbox of <project>", "send this to <project>'s inbox", "note this for <project>", "file this as a finding in <project>", "<project> needs to know that…". Writes one findings file into the target project; never touches the current project, code, issues, or specs.

# Send to Inbox

Turns a short note from the user into a self-contained finding and writes it to the target project's `.project/Inbox/`, where `project-meeting` triages it.

The `.project/` layout and written-deliverable sizing are defined in `../_shared/conventions.md` (relative to this skill's directory). Use `../_shared/runtime-adapters.md` for host-specific file listing, directory creation, and date.

## 1. Resolve the target project

- The user names the target as a path or a project name. A path is used as given (`~` expanded).
- A bare name: look for a directory of that name that contains `.project/` — first as a sibling of the current project root, then under the parent of that. Exactly one match → use it. Several or none → list what was found and ask for the path. Never guess.
- The target must contain `.project/`. If it doesn't, say so and stop — creating a project's workflow layout belongs to `kick-off` or `migrate-project`, not here.
- The target is the current project itself: proceed, but say so in the report.

## 2. Gather context

The finding is read later, in the target project, by someone who wasn't in this conversation. Collect what it needs to stand alone:

- **From the user's note and the current conversation**: what is needed, why, and what triggered it — e.g. a limitation hit while working in the source project, an interface the source project depends on, an idea that came up.
- **From the source** (the current working directory, if it is a different project): its name and the concrete detail that motivates the request — the API call, file, error, or behaviour involved. Read only what the note points at.
- **From the target**: the newest `.project/SPEC*.md` (by `Status: Active`, else newest milestone, else `SPEC.md`) — skim only enough to phrase the request in the target's own terms and to spot whether the spec already covers or contradicts it. List `.project/Inbox/findings-*.md`; if one already covers this, show it and ask whether to append to it or write a new file.

Missing a fact the finding can't be understood without (what exactly is needed, or why)? Ask — one question at a time, with a proposed answer.

## 3. Draft the finding

```markdown
# <Concise title stating the requirement>

- **Date**: <YYYY-MM-DD>   # current local date from the runtime adapter, never guessed
- **From**: <source project name or path, or "user" if no project context>
- **Type**: requirement | idea | bug | question

## Context
<What led to this, with the concrete source-side detail. Enough to understand it without the source project at hand.>

## Request
<What the target project should do or decide, as an outcome — not an implementation, unless the user specified one.>

## Notes
<Only if there is something: relation to the target's spec (already covered / contradicts section X), constraints, deadlines, open questions.>
```

Write it in the language the target's `.project/` documents use. Size it to its substance; drop `Notes` if empty.

## 4. Confirm, then write

- Show the draft and the target path `.project/Inbox/findings-<kebab-title>.md` (append `-2`, `-3` … if the name is taken). Write nothing until the user confirms; apply requested changes and show again.
- Create the target's `.project/` layout directories if any are missing, per conventions.
- Write the file. Do not commit — the target may have unrelated work in progress or another branch checked out; `project-meeting` commits the Inbox when it consumes the finding.

## 5. Report

State the written path and the title. Recommend `project-meeting` in the target project to triage it.
