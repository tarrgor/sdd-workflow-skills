# Verify Implementation

Reviews a finished implementation against its issue — does not implement or fix anything.

Use `../_shared/runtime-adapters.md` for host-specific subagent and file-listing behavior.

## 0. Review in a fresh context

The review must not run in the context that wrote the code — it needs both the independence and the context isolation.

- **Already running as the `verify-implementation` agent** (the subagent preloads this skill), or no review agent is installed for this host: do the review here, starting at Step 1. Installed means the `verify-implementation` subagent under Claude Code (`agents/verify-implementation.md`) and the `verify-implementation` custom agent under Codex (`agents/codex/verify-implementation.toml`, linked into the host's agents directory) — never check for the other host's file.
- **Otherwise** — invoked directly by the user, or from another skill: delegate to the named review agent using the current host mapping. Under Claude Code, retain the Agent-tool invocation (`subagent_type: verify-implementation`, `run_in_background: false`). Under Codex, spawn the installed `verify-implementation` custom agent. Pass the issue and PR numbers, wait for its final result, then report its findings per Step 4. Do not read the diff yourself first.

## 1. Identify the issue and its PR

- Identify the GitHub issue by number. If genuinely unclear, ask.
- Find the PR whose head branch is `issue/<issue-number>-*` (`gh pr list --search "head:issue/<issue-number>-"`, or `gh pr view <number>` if the PR number is already known; convention: `../_shared/conventions.md`). Read the linked issue in full.
- Note the acceptance criteria specifically — they're the review's checklist.
- Consult `.project/Knowledge/`, if present: list its subdirectory and file names using the host-native operation from `runtime-adapters.md`, and read only the entries whose names plausibly relate to this issue's area. Never read the tree wholesale; if nothing matches, skip it. A captured convention the diff violates is a valid finding — so is an entry whose asserted code/issue state (e.g. "unfixed", "not yet supported") this diff now contradicts; report that as stale knowledge rather than silently ignoring it.

## 2. Gather the diff

- `gh pr diff <number>`.
- Read every changed file's surrounding context, not just the diff hunks, before judging correctness.

## 3. Review

Check the diff from four angles:

- **Acceptance criteria** — does the change satisfy every criterion from the issue? Note any unmet or partially met.
- **Correctness** — logic errors, edge cases, regressions, missing or inadequate tests for the behavior change.
- **Security** — injection, auth/authorization gaps, unsafe deserialization, committed secrets, unvalidated input, unsafe defaults, and other OWASP-class flaws.
- **Knowledge accuracy** — does anything consulted in `.project/Knowledge/` assert a code/issue state this diff contradicts? Report it as stale, separate from the categories above.

Report every issue found, including low-severity ones and ones you are uncertain about. Do not filter for importance or confidence here — the caller triages. Coverage is the goal: a finding the caller discards costs less than a real bug silently dropped. Omit only pure style or naming preference.

## 4. Report findings

- Do not post to the PR. Return the findings directly to whatever invoked this skill, as the final output — that caller is responsible for anything further.
- For each finding: the acceptance criterion or file/line it relates to, what's wrong, why it matters, plus a severity and a confidence level so the caller can rank it. Group by acceptance criteria / correctness / security / stale knowledge.
- No findings: say so explicitly, stating which criteria were checked.
